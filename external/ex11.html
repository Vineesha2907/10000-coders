      Kwality, the original Indian company, was founded in 1956, and was the
      first in the region to import machinery for the mass production and sale
      of ice cream on a commercial scale. In 1995, in view of the growth
      potential of the frozen confections market, Kwality entered into an
      agreement with Lever, and has since been known by its current umbrella
      name. At the same time, other brands acquired by Hindustan Unilever, such
      as Gaylord-Milkfood, were phased out in favour of promoting the Kwality
      Wall's brand. This arrangement allows for local production and sale of
      Wall's products that are popular in its home market, such as the Cornetto
      cone, and to create local variations on others, such as the Feast Jaljeera
      Blast. Kwality Wall's was ranked 464th among India's most trusted brands
      according to the Brand Trust Report 2012, a study conducted by Trust
      Research Advisory. In the Brand Trust Report 2013, Kwality Wall's was
      ranked 632nd among India's most trusted brands and subsequently, according
      to the Brand Trust Report 2014, Kwality Wall's was ranked 382nd among
      India's most trusted brands.
